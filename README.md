Checkbox toggle buttons
-----------------------
I wanted to practice making checkboxes into toggle buttons by hiding the actual box and making the label change depending on state.  I turned it into a sort of themed exercise by making a launch status checklist for a "go/no-go poll".  I added some quick javascript to change launch status if all systems report go (checked state).
